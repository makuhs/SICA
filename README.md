## Abstract 
Antibiotics produced by soil-dwelling microbes are critical to advancements in disease resistance and human health, however, their natural role within soil ecosystems remains poorly understood. Traditionally viewed to function as inhibitory weapons at high concentrations, recent studies show that antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations (SICA) alter microbial metabolisms and phenotypes. This suggests a dual functionality of antibiotics as interspecies signaling agents at low concentrations, capable of shaping community nutrient use and resource competition. However, work to date has focused on isolates that lack a coevolutionary history and thus the extent to which SICA influence dynamics within the context of natural communities remains unclear. Here, we quantified the impacts of 6 antibiotics at SICA on nutrient use phenotypes and competition dynamics among Streptomyces isolates from 2 distinct communities coevolved in high and low nutrient soils. Overall, SICA altered primary metabolism in ways that significantly modified apparent resource competition among coevolved isolates. However, isolates taken from the low nutrient soil were found to be more resilient to changes in primary metabolism with SICA compared to high nutrient isolates, highlighting the ability of resource history to shape individual responses. Combinations of both positive and negative shifts in resource competition with SICA were found across all isolates suggesting the role of antibiotics are not easily fit into the monofunctional groups of ‘signal’ or ‘weapon’. Rather, this work suggests SICA mediate a broad spectrum of competitive outcomes likely to shape complex soil community dynamics and underscores the importance of contextualizing isolates within their surrounding community, nutrient habitat, and long-term evolutionary history.
